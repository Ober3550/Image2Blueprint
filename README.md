# Image2Blueprint
#Converts png images into blueprints according to a limited color pallette

# How to use. 
1. Have Python Installed (2 or 3). Download online -default install
2. Have Pillow Installed. Go to run -> cmd -> pip install pillow

3. Insert your desired png file into in_n_out
4. Open the 'image_to_blueprint' script with IDLE since it's both an editor and the interpreter.
5. There is a big red commented title saying "Input File Name" change the filename variable to whatever png you're working with.
6. It's not necessary to change the pallette but it should be pretty self-explanatory how they work. "vanilla" is Vanilla "alien_biomes" is Alien Biomes etc. You can make your own pallette files.
7. Press f5 to run the module. When the script is done it should display an image of the error-diffused image aswell as output a txt file of the same name as the input containing the blueprint string within the in_n_out file
