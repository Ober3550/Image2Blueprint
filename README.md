# Image2Blueprint
# Converts png images into blueprints according to a limited color pallette

# How to use. Have Python Installed (2 or 3). Go to run -> cmd -> pip install pillow
# Once pillow is installed you can run the script. 

# Insert your desired png file into in_n_out
# To edit which pallette file to use and which image to apply the magic to, open the 'image_to_blueprint' script.
# There is a big red commented title saying "Input File Name" change the filename variable to whatever png you're working with.
# It's not necessary to change the pallette but it should be pretty self-explanatory how they work
# Press f5 to run the module. When the script is done it should display an image of the error-diffused image 
# aswell as output a txt file of the same name as the input containing the blueprint string within the in_n_out file
